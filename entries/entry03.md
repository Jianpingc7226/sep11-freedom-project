 This week, I explored [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) from the video in youtube([Firebase - Ultimate Beginner's Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kRgVxULbag), [I built a chat app in 7 minutes with React & Firebase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQyrwxMPm88)) that will help me to had a better understanding of fire base and have a idea of how to creat user interaction function for my freedom project.
 <hr>
 I am currently at stage 4 of the Engineering Design Process - <b>Plan the most promising solution</b> on how to let the user interactive or communicate eachother, inother word, <b>increase user interaction.</b>
 <br>
   
 I have start brainstorming possible solutions, and combine with my personal experience on communicateing with others classmate or teach on app, I realize that many student are afraid of communication and reach out to others and teacher on a channels, instead they will often private chat their teacher.
 <br>  
   
 my <b>most promising solution</b> is to make chat or alow the user to anonymous their self to make them more comfortable to reach out to others if they have any question. And for the next step of Engineering Design Process, I plan to be on stage 5, <b>creating a prototype</b>, I will practice more on firebase, but the biggest problem I am faceing is to install firebase.

## Knowledge

the tool I have decided on is [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?authuser=1), it is Google's mobile application development platform that helps you build, improve, and grow your app. It is built on Google's infrastructure. Firebase is categorized as a NoSQL database program, which stores data in JSON-like documents.   
In this week, I had watch many youtube video about how to make set up firebase, what could firebase do, and many video about how to make cool stuff such as chat box by using firebase. Using what I've learned, I will started to practice once I set up my firebase(I face some erro when I try to setup my firebase)

Code snippets:

<tt><b>var dbRef = firebase.database().ref</tt></b><br>
↑firebase.database().ref() - creat a database reference

<tt><b>dbRef.on('value', snap => bigOne. innerText = snap.val());</tt></b><br>
↑synchronize any changes and ES2-15 functions can do it all in one line

<tt><b>Const app=firebase.app();<br>
console.log(app)</tt></b><br>
↑Output an object with all the firebase credentials and other things attached to that object
(this is not needed unless you want to make sure that firebase is available)

## Skills

the skills I use is <b>consideration and How to Google</b>
<br>
I used the skill, <b>How to Google</b> Google helped me a lot during my firebase learning. When I searched firebase on google, countless demonstrations and teaching videos, and many messages from learners like me helped me a lot.
<br>
I used the skill, <b>consideration</b> when I had to think how different student may react different when they are faceing a problem and try to reach out to others
