 After a half year quarantine lockdown done to the COVID-19, people are not staying in communication, especially the teacher and students. This is a considerable problem for many teachers, students are not communicating with each other and not reaching out to the teacher. this is also a problem for the students, They don't know who should they ask for help. So I want to make a remote academic forum that student's questions can answered by many other classmates or people outside the school, and teachers can see what questions the student have and reach out to them for the first time.
